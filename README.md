Whether you're deploying a lightweight website, API interfaces, or setting up a reverse proxy, everything runs smoothly without any lag.

### 2. Network Optimization: A Blessing for Telecom Users

Though it's a standard line, the domestic three-network return routes are all direct connections, performing exceptionally well.

- **China Telecom users:** Both outbound and return routes use the AS4134 backbone network, with latency as low as 150ms, comparable to some premium routes.
